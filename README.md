This repo records my statistics learning journey. Notes are taken to make sure that I can understand what I'm learning, and hopefully it will help you too.
**If you find any mistakes I've made, or there are potential improvements, please let me know!**

If you're unable to see the mathematical equations on GitHub's preview, you can download it and open with either Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or Kaggle Kernel.
